            <p>
              Four vessels from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen fired upon the Maersk Hangzhou and got within metres of the
              ship, the US military said.
              Helicopters from nearby US warships responded to a distress call - and, after being fired upon, sank three boats
              "in self-defence".
              The crews were killed and the fourth boat fled the area.A Houthi spokesperson said the vessel had refused to
              respond to warning calls, and that 10 of its group members were dead or missing after the incident.
