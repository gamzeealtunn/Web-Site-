        <p>The ship, scheduled to sail to the Bahamas this week, instead headed to New England and Canada “due to
          unseasonable and rapidly worsening weather that would have made it impossible to safely reach the southern
          Atlantic Ocean from New York City,” Field Sutton, director of communications, MSC Cruises USA, told CNN via

        <p>
          It’s Christmas every day on Christmas Island, the 52-square-mile jungle paradise that sits in the Indian Ocean
          about a 3.5-hour plane flight northwest of Perth, Australia. Its thriving reefs and 250 endemic species have
          earned it the nickname “The Galapagos of Australia,” but geographically, this remote gem lies closer to
          Indonesia than the Australian mainland.

          electronic travel authorisation in advance, instead of needing to apply for a visa.

          a visa to come to Kenya,” he said in a speech in the capital Nairobi at an event to mark 60 years of
