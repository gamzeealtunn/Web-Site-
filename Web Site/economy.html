            <h3 style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;">China’s economy had a miserable year. 2024 might be even
              worse</h3>
            <p> Between 1991 and 2011, it grew by 10.5% annually. The expansion has slowed during Chinese leader Xi
              Jinping’s rule, but was still averaging 6.7% in the decade through 2021.“The second half of the 2020s will … see
              slowing growth,” Scissors said, citing a correction in the troubled real estate sector coupled with demographic
              decline.The IMF has also become gloomier about the longer-term outlook. In November, it said it expected China’s
              growth
              rate to reach 5.4% in 2023, and gradually decline to 3.5% in 2028 amid headwinds ranging from weak productivity
              to an ageing population.</p>

              down</h3>
            <p>The U.K. is edging closer to a technical recession, after revised figures showed the economy shrank in the
              previous quarter.
              U.K. gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1% between July and September, in a downward revision from the
              earlier estimate of flat growth, according to the Office for National Statistics.
              The data could put further pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates sooner than planned in a bid to
              shore up a weaker economy.</p>

              forecast</h3>
            The European Central Bank on Thursday held interest rates
            steady for the second meeting in a row, as it revised its growth forecasts lower and announced plans to speed up
            the shrinking of its balance sheet.The bank was widely expected to leave policy unchanged in light of the sharp
            fall in euro zone inflation, as
            investors instead chase signals on when the first rate cut may come and assess the ECB’s plans to shrink its
            balance sheet.

            </h3>
            <p>The U.K. and Switzerland on Thursday signed a post-Brexit financial services deal designed to bring two of
              Europe’s largest banking centers closer together.
              British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt told CNBC that the “first-of-its-kind” deal was a win for post-Brexit
              Britain that “wouldn’t have been possible to sign” inside the European Union.
              “This is a new type of trade agreement that we can use as a model for future agreements that we have with other
              markets as well,” Hunt said.
