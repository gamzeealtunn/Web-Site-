      <p>
        Four vessels from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen fired upon the Maersk Hangzhou and got within metres of the
        ship, the US military said.
        Helicopters from nearby US warships responded to a distress call - and, after being fired upon, sank three boats
        "in self-defence".
        The crews were killed and the fourth boat fled the area.A Houthi spokesperson said the vessel had refused to
        respond to warning calls, and that 10 of its group members were dead or missing after the incident.

        worse</h3>
      <p> Between 1991 and 2011, it grew by 10.5% annually. The expansion has slowed during Chinese leader Xi
        Jinping’s rule, but was still averaging 6.7% in the decade through 2021.“The second half of the 2020s will … see
        slowing growth,” Scissors said, citing a correction in the troubled real estate sector coupled with demographic
        decline.The IMF has also become gloomier about the longer-term outlook. In November, it said it expected China’s
        growth
        rate to reach 5.4% in 2023, and gradually decline to 3.5% in 2028 amid headwinds ranging from weak productivity
        to an ageing population.</p>

        down</h3>
      <p>The U.K. is edging closer to a technical recession, after revised figures showed the economy shrank in the
        previous quarter.
        U.K. gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1% between July and September, in a downward revision from the
        earlier estimate of flat growth, according to the Office for National Statistics.
        The data could put further pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates sooner than planned in a bid to
        shore up a weaker economy.</p>

      The European Central Bank on Thursday held interest rates
      steady for the second meeting in a row, as it revised its growth forecasts lower and announced plans to speed up
      the shrinking of its balance sheet.The bank was widely expected to leave policy unchanged in light of the sharp

      </h3>
      <p>The U.K. and Switzerland on Thursday signed a post-Brexit financial services deal designed to bring two of

        British Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt told CNBC that the “first-of-its-kind” deal was a win for post-Brexit
        Britain that “wouldn’t have been possible to sign” inside the European Union.
        “This is a new type of trade agreement that we can use as a model for future agreements that we have with other
        markets as well,” Hunt said.
